This section is used to configure net rates and payment methods for Agents.

Available only for Supplier and his employees (if you set it in “Manage > Employees > Roles & Permissions). So they can create and edit net rates.

When you go to the section “Net Rates”, the tab “My Rates” opens. Sidebar on the left has 2 tabs: 
- “My Rates” - all Suppliers’ tours with tour options;
- “Agent Payment Methods” - all payment methods for Agents.
