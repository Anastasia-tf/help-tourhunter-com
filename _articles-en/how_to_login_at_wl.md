### **Step 2**

If you are a system user, enter your e-mail address and password which you set up during registration in the system. Click "Next" to complete authorisation. 

If you are an Agent, enter your agent code in the "Email or Login" field and your agent password in the "Password" field (if it is). Agent code and agent password are assigned to an Agent by a Supplier.
