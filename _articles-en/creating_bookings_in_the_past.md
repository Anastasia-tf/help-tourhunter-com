## **Permissions**

Owner or manager (or other employees) can book tours for a past date. They, as well as invited employees who have access to edit bookings, are allowed to reschedule the bookings to the past and current dates if session is already running. 

When you click on the "Save" button in the booking module the message "Are you sure you want to move this booking to a past date?" displays.

If the "Bookings > Manifest view" section is viewed by the Agent, and the session time has already begun, then the "+" icon of the session card will be inactive. When you hover over the icon, the tooltip "Past booking is not available" is displayed. It is not allowed to create a booking for such a session.
