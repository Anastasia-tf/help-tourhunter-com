### **Definition**

Agent is one of two types of companies available in the system. Agent is a company selling tours formed by the tour provider - Supplier (see also [*Supplier company*](https://help.tourhunter.com/en/category/getting-started/supplier-company/)).

Agent can create tour bookings of other Suppliers, add Suppliers to "My Suppliers".

Agent have three standard types of a subscriptions there are: Online Agent, Offline Agent, Premium Agent (see also [*Agent's subscriptions*](https://help.tourhunter.com/en/category/billing-payments/agents-subscriptions)).

### **Roles**

Participants in an agent company are divided into managers and employees, depending on their roles.

List of roles in a agent company:
- Manager:

1. Manager;
2. Booking manager;
3. Accountant.

- Employees:

1. Seller.

In addition to these roles, Owner has the ability to create new roles, name them at their discretion and assign them to the manager or employees group.

A new user can be invited to employees, for this a future employee is not required to be a user, he will register at the time of accepting the invitation. To invite employees, you need to fill in the data in the "Add User" module in "Manage > Employees > Add new Employee" and send an invitation.

In the profile in edit mode for each employee there is the option to enable the checkbox "Show in company profile". If Agent has enabled checkbox, employee is displayed in the profile of this company in the "Team" block. Only those employees who are already registered in the system or accepted the invitation are displayed.

Agent can makes bookings for tours in the sections:
- "Bookings > Manifest view" (only for Premium Agent or Supplier-Agent, those companies who have added foreign tours to the section "My Tours");
- "Marketplace" ("Marketplace > List view" or "Marketplace > Point-of-sale");
- "White Label" (on personal "White Label" or on Supplier's "White Label" when those Agent have been autorized).

Agent’s bookings made from "Marketplace > List view" immediately go to Supplier for confirmation; bookings made from "Marketplace > Point-of-sale" appear first in the "Checkout" module window and then go to the Supplier for confirmation.

Any type of Agent company can see his bookings which made by himself in "Bookings > Booking view", and also those bookings where Agent was indicated in "Booked By". The Agent can also change the booking data, but only if he is allowed to do this (a Supplier has enabled the "Can modify bookings" checkbox in the Agent’s profile in editing module).

If the Premium Agent makes a tour booking added to "My Tours", then he can see this booking in "Bookings > Manifest view" and "Bookings > Booking view".

Bookings of other tours that are not added to "My Tours" are only may be seen by the Premium Agent in "Bookings > Booking View" section, just like the regular Agent (Online Agent or Offline Agent).

If the Premium Agent makes a booking from "Booking > Manifest view", then this booking immediately go to a Supplier for confirmation, without falling into the "Checkout" module.
